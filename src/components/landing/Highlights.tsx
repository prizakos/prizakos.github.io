            A few steps from the property is Pine Lane, an exclusive, short footpath that leads you 
            directly to soft shoreline sands, shallow water entry and breathtaking sunsets, among the 
            best in the world. This is one of the best non-waterfront properties in Grand Bend.

            The large property with a circular driveway and two car garage, features an open concept 
            design with high ceilings, a finished basement with entertainment area, a living room gas 
            fireplace, two decks, a covered front porch perfect for rainy days, a gas BBQ, and an 
            outdoor fire pit stocked with firewood for roasting smores.

          <p>
            The residence is ideally positioned, just a pleasant stroll or easy bike ride from local 
            restaurants, and everyday conveniences, including grocery and specialty shops, the marina 
            and the Pinery Provincial Park. Whether your mornings begin with a forest or beach walk or 
            coffee on your deck lounger, everything you need is at your fingertips.
          </p>

            Active lifestyles are effortlessly accommodated, including hiking and cycling. Tennis and 
            pickleball courts and several golf courses are only minutes away by car. From morning sports 
            to sunset beach walks, this home offers a seamless blend of tranquility, recreation, and 
            vibrant beach living. Winter in Grand Bend offers plenty to enjoy, from snowshoeing, 
            cross-country skiing and skating to scenic winter hikes, including unforgettable walks along 
            the dramatic frozen shoreline of Lake Huron.

            The property has been used by the owner for fourteen years and though it has been rarely made 
            available to rent, it has commanded strong premium to seasonal rates due to location, size and 
            amenities. It provides an opportunity to try the lifestyle before you commit, as it allows for 
            full-time or extended seasonal living in Grand Bend - at a cost comparable to just renting it 
            for the peak summer period. Whether you are considering purchasing in the area, planning a longer stay, 
            or exploring a year-round lake lifestyle, this home allows you to truly live it - not just visit.
